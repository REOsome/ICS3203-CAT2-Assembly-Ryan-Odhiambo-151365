# Reverse Array Program Documentation

## Overview
This program accepts an array of integers as input, reverses the array in place without using additional memory, and outputs the reversed array. 

## Features
- Input: Accepts an array of integers from the user (e.g., 5 values).
- Output: Outputs the reversed array.
- Memory Efficiency: Reverses the array in place by swapping elements without allocating additional memory.
- Loops: Utilizes loops for efficient iteration through the array.

Code Explanation
Input Handling: Reads an array of integers from the user into memory.
Reversal Logic: Uses two pointers (start and end) to swap elements iteratively until the midpoint of the array is reached.
Output: Displays the reversed array on the console.

Limitations
The program assumes a fixed size for the array (e.g., 5 integers). Modifications are needed to handle dynamic array sizes.

Explanation of Key Implementation Details
Reversing the Array In Place
Logic:
Use two pointers: one starting at the beginning (ESI) and another at the end (EDI) of the array.
Swap the values pointed to by ESI and EDI.
Increment ESI and decrement EDI to move inward.
Repeat until the pointers meet in the middle (ECX controls the number of swaps, which is half the array size).
Avoiding Extra Memory:
Swapping is done in place using a temporary variable (AL).
The array is reversed by modifying its original content.

Challenges and Memory Handling
Memory Alignment:
In assembly, you must carefully manage memory locations to ensure proper alignment and avoid overwriting other data.
ASCII Conversion:
Handling ASCII-to-integer conversion for user input required careful manipulation to account for characters like spaces and newlines.
Indexing Without High-Level Constructs:
Since assembly lacks arrays or indexing operators, manual pointer arithmetic (ESI and EDI) is necessary to navigate the array.
