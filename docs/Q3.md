# Factorial Program Documentation

## Overview
This program calculates the factorial of a number using recursion and demonstrates stack usage for register preservation.

## Features
- Input: Accepts a single number as input.
- Output: Displays the factorial result.
- Stack usage: Preserves and restores registers during recursive calls.

Limitations
The program supports input values between 0 and 12. Input values beyond this range may cause overflow.

Code Explanation
Input Handling: Converts ASCII input to an integer.
Recursive Subroutine: Calculates the factorial using a base case and recursive calls.
Register Management: Preserves EBX and ECX on the stack to ensure modular functionality.

Preserving and Restoring Registers:
Push/Pop:
Registers used within the subroutine are saved on the stack at the beginning and restored before returning.
For example:
push ebx
push ecx
Saves the values of EBX and ECX before overwriting them.
pop ecx
pop ebx
Restores the values before the subroutine exits.

Stack Management:
The stack is used to pass arguments (e.g., n - 1 during recursion) and preserve the state of the calling function.
The base pointer (EBP) is used to create a stack frame, ensuring that the stack remains consistent during recursive calls.
