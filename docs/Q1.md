# Classify Number Program Documentation

## Overview
This program prompts the user to input a number and classifies it as "POSITIVE," "NEGATIVE," or "ZERO." It demonstrates the use of branching and both conditional and unconditional jumps.

## Features
- Input: Accepts a single number from the user.
- Output: Classifies the number as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or ZERO.
- Branching: Uses conditional jumps for decision-making and unconditional jumps to simplify program flow.

Code Explanation
Input Handling: Accepts an integer as input and converts it from ASCII to an integer.
Classification:
Compares the number to zero.
If greater than zero, jumps to the "POSITIVE" label.
If less than zero, jumps to the "NEGATIVE" label.
If equal to zero, prints "ZERO."
Unconditional Jumps: Used to simplify program flow by skipping unnecessary instructions.

Explanation of Jump Instructions
je (Jump if Equal): Used to handle the "ZERO" case after comparing the input to 0.
Reason: It makes the program jump to the appropriate label (print_zero) only if the input is 0.
js (Jump if Sign): Used to identify negative numbers (based on the sign bit).
Reason: Directly checks the sign of the number to determine if it's negative.
jmp (Unconditional Jump): Used to control flow by skipping over unnecessary labels or to exit cleanly.
Reason: Ensures a clear program flow, avoiding unintended fall-through.
