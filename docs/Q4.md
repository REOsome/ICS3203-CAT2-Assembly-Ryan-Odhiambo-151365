# Control Program Documentation

## Overview
This program simulates a control system for a water level sensor. Based on the sensor input, the program takes one of the following actions:
- Turns a motor ON or OFF.
- Triggers an alarm if the water level is too high.
- Stops the motor if the water level is moderate.

## Features
- Input: Simulates reading a sensor value from memory.
- Output: Reflects the motor and alarm states based on the sensor value.
- Control Logic: Uses thresholds to decide the appropriate action.

Code Explanation
Sensor Input: Simulates a water level sensor with a value between 0 and 100.
Control Logic:
If the value is above 75, triggers the alarm and stops the motor.
If the value is between 25 and 75, stops the motor and does not trigger the alarm.
If the value is below 25, turns the motor ON and ensures the alarm is OFF.
Memory Usage:
motor_status (memory location): Stores the state of the motor (ON or OFF).
alarm_status (memory location): Stores the state of the alarm (ON or OFF).

Limitations
The program assumes a single 8-bit value for the sensor input. It may require modifications for more complex inputs or multi-byte values.
